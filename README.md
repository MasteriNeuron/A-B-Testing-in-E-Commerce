## Overview 🔍

In this project, we implement an A/B testing framework to compare two versions of a website:
- **Control (Old Page):** The current design.
- **Treatment (New Page):** A redesigned version intended to improve conversions.

We analyze user behavior using Python and a suite of statistical tests to determine whether the new design significantly impacts conversion rates. 

---

## Project Objectives 🎯

- **Assess Conversion Rates:** Measure and compare the conversion rates of the control and treatment groups.
- **Statistical Confidence:** Use hypothesis testing (Z-test, T-test, Chi-Square, ANOVA, and Bayesian analysis) to ensure decisions are data-driven.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations based on the statistical outcomes to guide website optimization.

---

## Methodology 🧪

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   - Import and explore the dataset.
   - Clean the data by filtering mismatches and removing duplicates.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize user distributions, conversion rates, and session metrics.
   - Generate insights through bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and KDE plots.
   
3. **Statistical Testing & Simulation:**  
   - Conduct simulations and perform a proportions Z-test.
   - Run supplementary tests including T-tests, Chi-Square tests, and ANOVA.
   - Utilize Bayesian analysis to update conversion probabilities.

4. **Interpretation & Recommendations:**  
   - Analyze the results to determine if the new design has a statistically significant impact.
   - Offer business recommendations based on the findings.

## Project Setup & Workflow 🛠️

1. **Environment Preparation:**
   - Use **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** for an interactive coding experience.
   - Ensure Python is installed along with essential libraries:
     - `pandas`, `NumPy` for data handling.
     - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for visualization.
     - `SciPy`, `statsmodels` for statistical testing.

2. **Data Acquisition & Loading:**
   - Import the dataset (`ab_data.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform initial data exploration using functions like `.head()`, `.shape`, and `.isnull().sum()`.

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
   - Filter data to create a clean dataset where landing page matches the assigned group.
   - Remove duplicate records to ensure each user is uniquely represented.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Generate visualizations to understand user distribution and conversion metrics.
   - Calculate key statistics to provide a baseline for further analysis.

5. **Statistical Testing:**
   - Define hypotheses and run simulations to create a sampling distribution under the null hypothesis.
   - Apply various tests (Z-test, T-test, Chi-Square, ANOVA, Bayesian analysis) to assess significance.

6. **Results Reporting:**
   - Synthesize findings into actionable insights.
   - Document visualizations and test results in a well-organized notebook for stakeholder review.

## Data Analysis & Visualization 📊

Our visual analysis includes:
- **Bar Charts & Pie Charts:** Displaying user group proportions and conversion ratios.
- **Histograms & KDE Plots:** Showcasing the distribution of user IDs and conversion events.
- **Boxplots:** Comparing distributions across control and treatment groups.

These visualizations help to clearly communicate key trends and differences in user behavior.

---

## Statistical Testing 🔬

Key tests implemented include:
- **Proportions Z-Test:** To compare conversion rates.
- **T-Test:** For comparing means in smaller samples.
- **Chi-Square Test:** To explore independence between groups and conversion.
- **ANOVA:** For assessing differences in continuous variables such as session duration.
- **Bayesian Analysis:** To update and visualize conversion probabilities using Beta distributions.

Each test provides insights into whether observed differences are statistically significant or due to chance.

---

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- **Multi-Variant Testing:** Expand to A/B/C testing to evaluate multiple design changes simultaneously.
- **Extended Test Duration:** Run longer tests to capture seasonal trends and user behavior changes.
- **Enhanced Metrics:** Incorporate additional KPIs such as bounce rate, session duration, and user engagement metrics.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Develop dashboards for continuous monitoring and rapid decision-making.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Use predictive models to forecast conversion improvements and further refine design changes.

---

## Conclusion ✅

The analysis reveals that the new page design did not significantly improve conversion rates compared to the old page. While the differences observed were minimal, the rigorous statistical testing process provides a solid framework for future experiments. The insights gained guide further iterations and optimization strategies to enhance user experience and conversion performance.
